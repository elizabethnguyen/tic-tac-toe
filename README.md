# Tic-Tac-Toe

A Python-based program to play a basic game of tic-tac-toe. This was made as my first introduction to writing in Python and integrating graphics using the 'turtle' library.

## Usage
This game only runs locally. Fairly straight-forward: input names, shapes (x and o as the choices) and colors (based off of standard colors accepted by turtle).

## Future Plans
Although this project may not be revisited for quite some time, there are plans for a graphical update using ncurses, network capabilities, and a redesign of the victory and structure of the game.
